Edit a object will need:
	Work
	EditTool
	ToolManager
	Messager

	Change to tool:
		Qt change the panel for the tool;
		Qt send a message to Work, message contains the tool name and the parameters for the tool;
		Work response:
			call the ToolManager.changeToTool();
			clear the targets array;
			initialize the target(s) in the array using the parameters;

	Creating/Editing:
		creating is response by a EditTool, we call it "tool"; 
		Tool response for some mouse and keyboard events, on each event :
			it adjust the attributes of the targets it controls;
			send a message(maybe slow) to the Qt program telling current attributes of the targets.
			When the creating procedure finished, it send a message to Qt telling <ADD> or <MODIFY>. 
			Then Qt sends a message to ask the ToolManager to :
				1. clear the targets array 
				2. initialize targets.
